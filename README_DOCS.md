OpenOPO - Data Model is a project that was created to allow better portability of OPO (Organ Procurement Organization) data. This is an open source project, so if you would like to contribute, please feel free to make a PR to get something added or changed.

Currently, we have several models built out for the different entity types. You can find those listed in the table below or under the Exports section on the right.
